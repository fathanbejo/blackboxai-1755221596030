# Detailed Plan for Fixing the "Sesi Tidak Valid" Login Issue

## Overview
The login functionality is failing because the session cookie is not being properly set or retained. This issue is likely caused by the session cookieâ€™s domain configuration in the backend (api.php), which prevents the browser from sending the cookie with subsequent requests. We will update the session cookie settings to fix the invalid session error.

## Affected Files and Dependencies
- **api.php**: Handles authentication, session creation, and session persistence.
- **login.js**: Manages form submission and redirect after login.
- **auth-helper.js**: Provides session checking and protection functions.
- **api-helper.js**: Centralizes API calls and error handling.
  
*Note: Ensure that PHP sessions are managed by the DatabaseSessionHandler and that all front-end API calls use `credentials: 'include'`.*

## Step-by-Step Changes

### 1. Update Session Cookie Settings in `api.php`
- **Change 1:** Locate the session initialization block (before any output).
- **Change 2:** Modify the `session_set_cookie_params` call:
  - **Before:**
    ```php
    session_set_cookie_params([
        'lifetime' => 86400,
        'path' => '/',
        'domain' => '',
        'secure' => (isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] === 'on'),
        'httponly' => true,
        'samesite' => 'Lax'
    ]);
    ```
  - **After:** Replace `'domain' => ''` with:
    ```php
    'domain' => $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
    ```
- **Change 3:** (Optional) After `session_regenerate_id(true);` in the login action, add logging (using error_log) to output the new session ID for debugging.
  
### 2. Verify and Confirm in `login.js`
- Ensure that the API call for login (via `apiCall`) correctly uses `credentials: 'include'` (already implemented).
- (Optional) Add a console log after a successful login to confirm user data and that redirection delays are working as expected.
  
### 3. Review and Maintain `auth-helper.js`
- Confirm that the `checkSession()` function leverages the updated session state.
- No code changes are required; ensure that proper session data is cached after login.

### 4. Confirm Error Handling in `api-helper.js`
- Verify that the fetch options include `credentials: 'include'` and that 401 responses redirect to `login.html` as designed.
- Ensure that network errors and malformed JSON responses are logged and handled gracefully.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Use browser developer tools to confirm that the session cookie (e.g., PHPSESSID) is set with the proper domain.
- Test the login workflow using both valid and invalid credentials.
- Use curl commands to validate responses for login and check_session endpoints.
- Verify that after a successful login the user is redirected to `index.html` and that the session persists for subsequent API calls.

---

**Summary:**
- Update `api.php` to set the session cookie domain to `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`.
- Ensure all API calls include credentials so that cookies are transmitted.
- Confirm that the session is correctly maintained after login and validated through `checkSession()`.
- Verify API error handling in `api-helper.js` remains robust.
- Test the complete login process using browser dev tools and curl commands.
